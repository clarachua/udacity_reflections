How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    - Easier to spot answer

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    See what kind of changes were made so you don't repeat the same changes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Good, I'm used to this.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Version is per file and not per commit

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows the log of all commits.  Git diff shows diff between 2 commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Less so but I'm still afraid I'll break something with version control

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Try using Git with my coding stuff
